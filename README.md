# üõ°Ô∏è MYDFIR 30-Day Microsoft Challenge

## üéØ Purpose

I recently joined the **MyDFIR SOC Communty Program**, which is designed to help participants gain **hands-on experience** and develop **job-ready cybersecurity skills** through practical labs, guided projects, and real-world simulations.  

As part of this journey, I‚Äôm sharing my work on the **Microsoft 30-Day Security Challenge**, one of several projects within the program. 

By documenting my progress, I aim to showcase my technical growth, demonstrate my ability to apply SOC concepts in real-world scenarios, and strengthen my expertise in cybersecurity operations.

## üìò Project Overview
This repository documents my progress in the **Microsoft 30-Day Challenge**, where I‚Äôm building and managing a **cloud-based  (SOC)** from scratch using **Microsoft Sentinel** and other Microsoft security tools.

The goal of this challenge is to gain hands-on experience in modern cloud SOC operations from environment setup to incident investigation and response, with a focus on phishing analysis, threat detection, and incident reporting.

**Tools used**
- Microsoft Sentinel  
- Microsoft Azure  
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint  
- Microsoft 365 Security  

**Skills practiced**
