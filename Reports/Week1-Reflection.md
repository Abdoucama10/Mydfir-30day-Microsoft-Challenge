# 💭 Week 1 — Reflection

## 🧩 Overview
In Week 1 of the **30-Day Microsoft Security Challenge**, I focused on building the foundation of my cloud SOC using Microsoft Sentinel and Azure resources.  

I set up my lab environment, connected Defender for Endpoint and XDR, and explored how data flows between them. This week gave me a solid understanding of how Microsoft tools integrate within a SOC.
